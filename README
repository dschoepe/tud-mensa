This program displays the TU Darmstadt cafeteria menu on the command
line. For usage information see mensa --help.

Additional customization is possible by altering/creating
~/.config/tud-mensa/tud-mensa.hs which is a Haskell file that should
contain alternate code for the `main' function. This code would result
in the same behaviour as without configuration:

> import TUDMensa

> main = tudMensa defaultOpts

To set a default, e.g. always ignore fish-based dishes, the file can
be altered like this:

> import TUDMensa
> main = tudMensa defaultOpts { hide = [Fish] }

Those customization options require GHC to be installed.
For other customization options, refer to the haddock documentation of
this program.
